# Ibm_RL-project

A few headways have been made as of late in the field of transportation framework and cabs being a significant piece of metropolitan transportation has seen a huge development in the previous few years using on the web taxi administrations, for example, Uber, Ola and so on.

A ton of studies were made in the clientâ€™s viewpoint to give improved client experience. But in this project, the objective is to fabricate a RL-based calculation which can help taxi drivers augment their benefits by improving their dynamic interaction on the field.

We will work with DQN, DQN is a reinforcement learning algorithm where a deep learning model is built to find the actions an agent can take at each state.
